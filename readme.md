Pronterface-Projector GTK-3 add on files for Windows 10 x64
==========================================================

Status WIP

This repository will become a submodule of Printrun and include Windows specific binaries that are needed for Projector.

The files are extracted from the GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment that is based on repository https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer by Tom Schoonjans. 
This repository will include only DLL files needed by cairocffi and cairosvg. The files are not modified.
